xdg-open "115 fixed .html"
```

**Method 3: Node.js HTTP Server**
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to project directory and start server
cd /path/to/115.html
http-server -p 8080

# Then open your browser to:
# http://localhost:8080/115%20fixed%20.html
```

**Method 4: PHP Built-in Server**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/115.html

# Start PHP server
php -S localhost:8080

## üñ®Ô∏è Zebra Printer Setup (Required for Direct Printing)

To use the Zebra label printing functionality:

### 1. Install Zebra Browser Print
```bash
# Download and install from:
# https://www.zebra.com/us/en/software/printer-software/browser-print.html

# The service will run on https://localhost:9101
```

### 2. Connect Your ZT230 Printer
- Connect via USB or network
- Ensure the printer is powered on and ready
- Test connection using the "Test Print" button in the app

### 3. Browser Security Settings
Since the Zebra Browser Print service runs on `localhost:9101` with HTTPS, you may need to:
- Accept the self-signed certificate warning
- Add `localhost:9101` to trusted sites if prompted

## üìã Features Overview

- **CSV Import**: Upload Cutting List and Board Master CSV files
- **Optimization**: Advanced nesting algorithms for material efficiency
- **Visualization**: Interactive cutting diagrams with zoom/pan
- **Label Printing**: Both browser and direct Zebra printer support
- **PDF Export**: Generate printable sheets
- **Project Management**: Save/load projects locally
- **Analytics**: Material utilization reports

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

Sample CSV files are provided in the `samples/` directory:

**Simple Examples (start here):**
- `simple_cutting_list.csv` - Minimal example with 3 parts
- `simple_board_master.csv` - Basic board sizes

**Complex Examples:**
- `sample_cutting_list.csv` - Complete cabinet project with doors, shelves, panels, and edging
- `sample_board_master.csv` - Multiple materials and grain directions

**To test the application:**
1. Start the application using one of the methods above
2. Click "üìã Upload Cutting List" and select a cutting list CSV
3. Click "üìè Upload Board Master" and select the corresponding board master CSV
4. Click "üöÄ Process CSVs" to generate cutting diagrams
5. Navigate through different material tabs to see the optimized layouts

**Tip:** Start with the simple examples first to verify everything works, then try the complex ones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Can't load external resources" or CORS errors**
- Use an HTTP server (Methods above) instead of opening the file directly
- Don't open with `file://` protocol for full functionality

**2. "Please select both CSV files" or CSV processing errors**
- Ensure CSV files have the exact required headers:
  - **Cutting List**: `Name`, `Length`, `Width`, `Quantity`, `Material`
  - **Board Master**: `Material`, `board length  `, `board width  ` (note the trailing spaces!)
- Make sure files are properly formatted CSV (comma-separated)
- Check that there are no extra blank lines or special characters

**3. Zebra printer not detected**
- Ensure Zebra Browser Print is installed and running
- Check if `https://localhost:9101` is accessible
- Verify printer is connected and powered on

**4. JavaScript errors**
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Clear browser cache and reload

### CSV Format Requirements:

**Cutting List CSV must have these headers (exact case):**
- Name, Length, Width, Quantity, Material
- Optional: Can Rotate (0 = No / 1 = Yes / 2 = Same As Material), Edging Length 1, Edging Length 2, Edging Width 1, Edging Width 2, Note 1, Note 2

**Board Master CSV must have these headers (note trailing spaces):**
- Material, board length  , board width  
- Optional: Thickness, CanRotate, Kerf, Grain Direction
